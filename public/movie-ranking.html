<hr />

<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>My whole youth I've been watching this anime. I like the story behind it. Since the Wano Kuni Saga I love the special effects.</p>

<h3>Rick and Morty</h3>
<p>It's a funny adult animated series. Where the jokes are quite dark. Great for when you are bored.</p>

<h3>Raising Voices</h3>
<p>A realistisc film about the catastrophic consequences of crazy partying.</p>
